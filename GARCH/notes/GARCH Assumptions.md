### **Assumptions for GARCH Model**

The **Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)** model is used for modeling time series with **heteroskedasticity** (changing volatility over time). It extends the **ARCH** model by adding an autoregressive component to the variance.

To apply a **GARCH(p, q)** model, the following assumptions must hold:

---

### **1. Stationarity of Returns (rtr_t)**

- The time series (e.g., log returns) should be **weakly stationary** (constant mean and variance).
- This is typically ensured by **differencing** or **removing trends**.
- You can check stationarity using the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test**.

---

### **2. Zero Mean for Residuals (Ïµt\epsilon_t)**

- The residuals (Ïµt\epsilon_t) from the mean equation should have **zero mean**: E[Ïµt]=0E[\epsilon_t] = 0
- If the residuals have a trend, the model may not be appropriate.

---

### **3. Conditional Heteroskedasticity**

- The series should exhibit **volatility clustering**â€”periods of high volatility followed by high volatility, and low volatility followed by low volatility.
- This means that **large shocks are likely followed by large shocks** (positive or negative).

---

### **4. Residuals (Ïµt\epsilon_t) are Normally Distributed (Optional but Ideal)**

- Ideally, residuals should be normally distributed.
- However, financial time series often show **fat tails**, requiring adjustments (e.g., Student-t or skewed distributions).

---

### **5. No Serial Correlation in Residuals**

- The squared residuals (Ïµt2\epsilon_t^2) should be uncorrelated over time.
- If there is autocorrelation, the model might be misspecified.
- Use the **Ljung-Box Test** to check for autocorrelation.

---

### **6. GARCH Process is Well-Defined**

- The **sum of GARCH coefficients** (Î± + Î²) should be **less than 1** for stationarity: Î±+Î²<1\alpha + \beta < 1
    - If **Î± + Î² = 1**, the model follows an **Integrated GARCH (IGARCH)** process, which has a unit root in variance.
    - If **Î± + Î² > 1**, the variance is explosive, meaning the model is unstable.

---

### **7. Innovations are Conditionally Homoskedastic**

- The error terms (Ïµt\epsilon_t) should have **conditionally constant variance** given past information: Var(Ïµtâˆ£Ftâˆ’1)=Ïƒt2Var(\epsilon_t | \mathcal{F}_{t-1}) = \sigma_t^2
    - The model assumes that the variance follows the **GARCH equation** and does not depend on external factors.

---

### **Conclusion**

To apply GARCH, ensure: âœ… The return series is **stationary** (use ADF test).  
âœ… There is **volatility clustering** in the data.  
âœ… The **residuals have zero mean** and **no autocorrelation**.  
âœ… The **sum of GARCH coefficients (Î± + Î²) < 1** for stationarity.
