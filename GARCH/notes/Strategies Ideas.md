### **1. Volatility-Based Pair Trading**

- **Concept**: Use the GARCH model to estimate and compare the volatilities of two correlated assets (e.g., stocks or ETFs). When their relative volatilities deviate significantly from historical norms, open a pair trade.
- **Implementation**:
    1. Fit GARCH models on both assets to forecast their volatilities.
    2. Calculate a ratio or spread of volatilities.
    3. If the ratio exceeds a threshold (e.g., 2 standard deviations from the mean), go long on the less volatile asset and short on the more volatile one.
    4. Close the trade when the ratio reverts.


### **2. Conditional Position Sizing**

- **Concept**: Use GARCH to dynamically adjust position sizes based on predicted market volatility.
- **Implementation**:
    1. Forecast market volatility for your portfolio using GARCH.
    2. Allocate smaller capital to positions when volatility is high and larger capital when volatility is low (risk-adjusted exposure).
    3. Incorporate stop-loss levels based on forecasted conditional variance.


### **3. Regime-Switching Strategies**

- **Concept**: Combine GARCH with a Markov-switching model to identify market regimes (e.g., low-volatility vs. high-volatility environments).
- **Implementation**:
    1. Use the GARCH model to forecast volatility.
    2. Overlay regime detection to classify the market into risk-on or risk-off states.
    3. Trade based on the detected regime:
        - High volatility: Trade short-term mean-reverting strategies.
        - Low volatility: Trade trend-following strategies.
