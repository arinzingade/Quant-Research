ACF: Reveals overall correlation between a time series and its lagged values at various time intervals.,,,,,,
"PACF: Focuses on the direct correlation of a time series with its lagged values, removing the influence of intermediate lags.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
GARCH models assume that volatility is conditionally heteroskedastic and exhibits autocorreletion over time.,,,,,,
"ACF and PACF help detect these dependancies in the data, especially in the squared residuals or returns (a key input into the GARCH model).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"IF there is no autocorrelation in the data, then there maybe no need of doing the GARCH modelling.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"For a model, GARCH (p, q)",,,,,,
the p value is given by the lags in the PACF plot,,,,,,
the q value is given by the lags in the ACF plot,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"I have perfomed the ACF-PACF test on the squared returns, and below is the output that I get - which verifies and cross-validates the use of GARCH further.",,,,,,
